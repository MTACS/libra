**THIS IS NOWHERE COMPLETE**

**Feel free to improve on this. ALl I ask is you don't take it and claim it as your own, I'd love to work with someone to get this complete**

broken

- subfolder uicollectionview doesn't always register the cellidentifier2 LibraCell cell class making buttons untappable
- returning to main view with dismissStack: doesn't seem to register the cellIdentifier1 LibraCell cell class
- loading apps in subfolder sometimes is blank
- 2x2 grid not loading properly for genres with 4 + icons
- transitions aren't like iOS 14
- badges in subfolders, maybe needs SBIconViews pulled from controller instead of buttons
- app labels in subfolders

needs to be added

- search needs to be implemented (I have it from Symbols)
- subfolders need better dismiss gesture so collectionview can be fullscreen


maybe

custom pods
